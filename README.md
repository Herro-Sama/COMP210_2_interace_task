MechFlight is a Space Mech flight experience where, the player controls their Mech from the cockpit while fighting enemy mechs. This is a prototype so it lacks much of the depth of a full game but it has been an interesting game to develop and work on.

If this project was taken on to be fully developed I think that it could do very well as their isn't another game like this one on the market currently. Though similar titles are available and I will show the details below.

## User Stories:

As the User I want to feel immersed in the cockpit of the mech with audio to represent what I'm doing.

As the User I want to feel like I am controlling the mech, through the use of real world controllers.
